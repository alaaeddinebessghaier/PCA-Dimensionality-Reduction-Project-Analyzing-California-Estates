In our exploration of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we delve into one of the most widely used algorithms for dimensionality reduction. We aim to demonstrate a practical example that combines both feature extraction and feature selection techniques to achieve our desired goal: reducing the number of dimensions in our dataset. PCA allows us to transform the original variables into uncorrelated components, known as principal components, which are ordered by the variance they explain. This process simplifies complex datasets, aiding in better understanding the underlying structure and improving the performance of machine learning models.
